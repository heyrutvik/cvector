Simple implementation of C vector library.

To build:
    1>  pull repo
    2>  change directory to cvector folder
    3>  enter 'make' command
    4>  it will create shared library 'libcvector.so'

To use:
    1>  add cvector.h to c file
    2>  compile using gcc with, 
        -L to tell gcc where to find library
        -Wl,-rpath to tell linker where to find library at run time
        -lcvector to pass library name
        (you can use any other methods to do all this steps)
    3>  use 'cvector_size' global variable to assign initial value for
        array size.
